- `scripts/survival_network_meta_analysis.R`: R script for executing survival and network meta-analysis.
- `scripts/survival_network_meta_analysis.Rmd`: R Markdown with annotated code and explanation.
- `outputs/`: (Optional) Folder to store rendered reports or results.

## Requirements

Install the following R packages:

```r
install.packages(c("survival", "netmeta", "dplyr", "tidyr", "ggplot2"))
```

## How to Use
